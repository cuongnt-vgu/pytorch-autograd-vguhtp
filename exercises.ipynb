    "Some of the questions use mathematical symbols and equations to depict the scenario. These are just some basic \"formal\" definitions and you should understand them. In case you haven't understood them, read again and give yourself sometime to ponder.

This function outputs a result for a multi-dimension input, where $x_j$ is the j-th feature of the input. Implement this function, return the gradients of each weight for a given input `x` and the output using `tuple` with the formar `(output, weight_grads_tensor)`.

    "### Q3: Suppose each feature $x_j$ needs a separate function $f_j(x_j)$, where $f_j(x_j) = w_j x_j + b_j$. In other words, each feature requires a function, which has a separate set of 1 weight and 1 bias. Therefore, the output $y$ of your function $G(x)=[f_1(x_1), f_2(x_2), ..., f_n(x_n)]$ should be $y = [(w_1 x_1 + b_1), (w_2 x_2 + b_2), ..., (w_n x_n + b_n)]$ (**note:** these are matrices written lazily with markdown). Implement the function $G(x)$, return the output and the gradient sets for each function for a given `x`. The weights should be randomized using `torch.randn()`, and the bias is the same as $j$ of $f_j()$ (for example: $b_1 = 1.0$, $b_2 = 2.0$). The input used by the autograder will be the same size as the one given below."
